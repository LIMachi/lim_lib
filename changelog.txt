---- 1.20.1-0.2.0 ---
port to neoforge
fixed many bugs

---- 1.20.1-B1.3 ----
port to 1.20.1
had to redo tabs
some command args are currently lost (missing ressources arg)
most of the GUI need to be updated (not done for now)

---- 1.19.2-B1.2.5 ----
updated curio integration to use SlotAccess instead of my own structure (thanks vanilla)
also use Capability instead of helper, and moved curios specific classes to lazy class (to prevent crash if calls to curios integration is used while curio isn't loadded)

---- 1.19.2-B1.2.4 ----
message no longer require an index, instead it will be calculated by sorting all messages by name (derived from class name if not set)
messages can no longer be declared for another mod (what was I thinking 0_o?)

---- 1.19.2-B1.2.3 ----
extensive testing and upgrades to the capability system and nbt auto serialization
(see RegisterCapability annotation, ITestCapability and TestCapabilityImpl)

---- 1.19.2-B1.2.2 ----
some quick fixes
added a prototype of capability managing system

---- 1.19.2-B1.2.1 ----
fix root widget not calling the correct tooltip gatherer, added simple method to add a default tooltip for widgets
fixed some errors in WidgetContainerScreen
tested and fixed some behaviors in History data structure (was using wrong indexes when rewriting history, resulting in loss of pages)

---- 1.19.2-B1.2 ----
very big changes to widgets (and screens using widgets): completely rewritten to allow better rendering and event management.
this means that screens that use the new widget system MUST extend WidgetContainerScreen!

---- 1.19.2-B1.1 ----
new widgets (button, text field, cycling button)
reworked some aspects of the basic widget
new message to send any (tag) data from a client menu to a server menu (if the menu implements IAcceptUpstreamNBT)

---- 1.19.2-B1.0.1 ----
quick fix of widget hover detection catching 1 pixel outside the widget

---- 1.19.2-B1.0 ----
moved to beta (to fix visibility issues with CurseForge)
moved ProxySlotModifier outside the CuriosIntegration class
new render utils to create overlays on blocks
added back client events
fixed bug with keymap controller
added scroll system on NbtTooltip (for NBT too big to render)
changed teleport to use double instead of float (fixing rounding error on far teleports)
new client annotation to register Model Properties on items
StaticInitClient is now compatible with static methods

---- 1.19.2-A1.3.0 ----
removed redundant TOP code
fixed config duplication/bleeding in other config files
temporary disabling the construct enforcer system as it was loadding unwanted (client) classes (server side)
fixed save datas not working with multiple instances of data (datas using the : where not sync client side)

---- 1.19.2-A1.2.1 ----
forgot to do a changelog for the previous versions, oupsy :P
fixed ConstructorEnforcer class loadding facultative classes, resulting in crashes if JEI or TOP is not loadded
better integration with JEI info and TOP
made MethodHolder compatible with string representation of classes and method path
reorganised registries
added skip option in registries: allows annotations to not register objects if a condition is not met
added redstone tint annotation for blocks (will generate a tint on all channels by searching the states POWER and POWERED of the block)
added stage concept to @StaticInit and made @StaticInit also work with public static methods
AbstractSyncSaveData no longer require the constructor with Sync and the annotation no longer defines Sync (just set the field manually in your constructor)
changed method prototype IScrollBlock#canScroll to get the player instead of the level
added method to test the validity of a real player (in oposition to FakePlayer) in EntityUtils
test can be disabled via config (by default they are disabled)
added a utility to generate blocks using a config file (POC)
working on utils for NBT serialisation
added sound utils (mostly to play records)

---- 1.19.2-A1.0.1 ----
Added multi level support to SaveDataManager (until now all save data where forced on overworld, now you can optionally specify the level to store the data)
World now has a method to iterate on all available worlds, regardless of side
CommandManager now will use defaults instead of null for Primitives (prevent crash when trying to use primitives like 'int', 'float', etc... as parameter of a method but parameter is facultative in script)
To achieve the above change, reflection.Types now expose a method 'getDefault' that will return a non null primitive if the given class is a primitive
CommandManager is now compatible with method starting with 'CommandContext<CommandSourceStack>', 'CommandSourceStack' or none of the two
To achieve the above change, reflection.MethodHolder now expose the static builder 'fromFirstMatching' that will try to find the first name method in a class and extract the parameter types from the found method

---- 1.19.2-A1.0.0 ----
port to 1.19.2
removed mixins
added VERSION comments to quickly locate what changed between 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 (which should also help with backport from 1.19.2 to 1.18.2)
update java version to 17.0.4

---- A1.0.2 ----
Added utilities for containers, menus, screens, widgets, itemstacks, DataSlot, BlockEntities...
Commands can now have facultative argument (declared with a ? in the name), you can set a default return for the getters by using AbstractCommandArgument#setDefault, will return null object as a parameter otherwise.
Reorganised reflection and added a string representation for MethodHolder.
Added AbstractContainerMenu (might be changed) and BaseContainerBlockEntity to the constructor enforcer.
Added a new registry annotation: RegisterBlockEntity, also updated RegisterBlockItem.
Reworked the blit functions in RenderUtils to offset the blit using the screen coordinates (facultative).
Added info methods to Log, and added configs to change the log behavior.
Added a way of serializing level keys in World.
Added a config to disable the NBT tooltip behavior.
Added assets for screens (generic background, slots, disabled slots, scroll bar).
Changes to the access transformer to be able to move slots visually client side.
