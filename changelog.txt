---- 1.19.2-A1.0.1 ----
Added multi level support to SaveDataManager (until now all save data where forced on overworld, now you can optionally specify the level to store the data)
World now has a method to iterate on all available worlds, regardless of side
CommandManager now will use defaults instead of null for Primitives (prevent crash when trying to use primitives like 'int', 'float', etc... as parameter of a method but parameter is facultative in script)
To achieve the above change, reflection.Types now expose a method 'getDefault' that will return a non null primitive if the given class is a primitive
CommandManager is now compatible with method starting with 'CommandContext<CommandSourceStack>', 'CommandSourceStack' or none of the two
To achieve the above change, reflection.MethodHolder now expose the static builder 'fromFirstMatching' that will try to find the first name method in a class and extract the parameter types from the found method

---- 1.19.2-A1.0.0 ----
port to 1.19.2
removed mixins
added VERSION comments to quickly locate what changed between 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 (which should also help with backport from 1.19.2 to 1.18.2)
update java version to 17.0.4

---- A1.0.2 ----
Added utilities for containers, menus, screens, widgets, itemstacks, DataSlot, BlockEntities...
Commands can now have facultative argument (declared with a ? in the name), you can set a default return for the getters by using AbstractCommandArgument#setDefault, will return null object as a parameter otherwise.
Reorganised reflection and added a string representation for MethodHolder.
Added AbstractContainerMenu (might be changed) and BaseContainerBlockEntity to the constructor enforcer.
Added a new registry annotation: RegisterBlockEntity, also updated RegisterBlockItem.
Reworked the blit functions in RenderUtils to offset the blit using the screen coordinates (facultative).
Added info methods to Log, and added configs to change the log behavior.
Added a way of serializing level keys in World.
Added a config to disable the NBT tooltip behavior.
Added assets for screens (generic background, slots, disabled slots, scroll bar).
